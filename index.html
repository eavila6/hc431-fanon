                        Frantz Fanon, born July 20th, 1925, was a Martinican psychologist-turned-philosopher who published a quintessential perspective for dissecting the role, effects, and aftermath of colonialism titled Black Skin, White Masks.
                        Though Fanon had originally published the book specifically to address the effects of colonialism for Black Martinican subjects, the concepts discussed can be applied more generally due to the transitive and indiscriminate nature of colonialism.

                    <p>
                        The most relevant topic discussed within Black Skin, White Masks is the role of violence.
                        Violence relies upon social constructs of oppression, which are arbitrary in nature and only serve the purpose of dividing a community to create a disparity in power.
                        In BSWM, this is usually Blackness and Whiteness, but the concepts of violence Fanon talks about could be easily applied to other groups, such as workers and employers.

                    <p>
                        It’s important to know Fanon’s book centralizes on the psychological effects of this power disparity, which does make crafting a solution difficult since the topic of discussion is on the description of the problem, not about actually resolving said issue.
                        Fanon does reach what he considers to be the foundation of a possible solution: one founded on violence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The warring between Blackness and Whiteness is a vicious cycle.
                        The colonial mindset and exploitation permeates throughout the communities that it infiltrates, which allows it to set up a tail-eating snake situation:
                        the colonizers subjugate an initial population of subjects, and then set them off to subjugate more people, who then go out to conquer more, and more until there’s nothing left to colonize.
                        Fanon prescribes a cure:
                        to resist the colonial mindset by any means possible.

                        This involves many things, such as cultural preservation and pride, but often starts with things like picket lines and walkouts—
                        activities we see in labor activism.
                        Essentially, resisting the forcefully imposed status quo is the first of many steps in order to break colonial oppression.
                        And by not engaging in this violence, by not partaking in the resistance, you get sucked under and continue to suffer as you did before.
