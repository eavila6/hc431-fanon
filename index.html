                    <h1><em>Who was Frantz Fanon?</em></h1>
                    <p>
                        Frantz Fanon, born July 20th, 1925, was a Martinican psychologist-turned-philosopher who published a quintessential perspective for dissecting the role, effects, and aftermath of colonialism titled Black Skin, White Masks.
                        Though Fanon had originally published the book specifically to address the effects of colonialism for Black Martinican subjects, the concepts discussed can be applied more generally due to the transitive and indiscriminate nature of colonialism.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The most relevant topic discussed within Black Skin, White Masks is the role of violence.
                        Enslaved subjects catch the sickness that is the colonial subject mentality which makes them horribly ill.
                        The colonizer casts them into the depths of Blackness, a concept with the sole purpose of upholding power—
                        eerily similar to the dynamic between the worker and the employer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The colonized then spends the rest of their life clawing, grasping, trying to become White—
                        the only cure to their condition—
                        and to then hold a semblance of power in their society.
                        Fanon dissects this condition and forms a hypothesis:
                        colonialism begets neuroticism not just to the colonized, but to the colonizer as well.
                        This way of life is not natural;
                        it kills from the inside out and makes life miserable.
                        By the end of the book, Fanon prescribes a cure:
                        for the colonized to employ violence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This notion of being violent is important because it’s more specifically the rejection of the forced status quo imposed by those in power.
                        People are worthy of respect and have a rich cultural background, but Blackness and Whiteness obscures this fact and instead pits the two against each other.
                        Blackness and Whiteness are constructs of exploitation.
                        By not being violent, one is sucked into the machinations of exploitation.
