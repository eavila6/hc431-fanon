                        Frantz Fanon, born July 20th, 1925, was a Martinican psychologist-turned-philosopher who published a quintessential perspective for dissecting the role, effects, and aftermath of colonialism titled <em>Black Skin, White Masks</em> (BSWM).
                        Though Fanon had originally published the book specifically to address the effects of colonialism for Black Martinican subjects, the concepts developed within the thesis can be applied more generally due to the transitive and indiscriminate nature of colonialism.

                        The most relevant topic discussed within <em>Black Skin, White Masks</em> is the role of violence.
                        The word violence is a little misleading.
                        Rather, the word should be seen as synonymous to resistance and is best described as going against the grain or refusing to meld with the oppressive status quo.
                        This form of violence only really exists as a result of social constructs of oppression, which are arbitrary in nature and only serve the purpose of dividing a community to create a disparity in power.
                        In BSWM, this is primarily refusing to accept Blackness and Whiteness.
                        Since the concepts of violence Fanon talks about are transitive, we can extend this discussion to that of the division between the employee and employer.

                        It’s important to bring up the fact that Fanon’s discussion centralizes almost exclusively on the psychological effects of this power disparity rather than trying to “fix” the issue.
                        He entertains the idea that violence is a means to an end, but it’s largely up to the reader to craft a solution for themselves.
                        Fanon clearly illustrates the division between Blackness and Whiteness as a vicious cycle, a tail-eating snake.
                        I say the key to breaking the cycle is to engage in violence, which includes but isn’t limited to:
                        cultural preservation and pride, creating picket lines and walking out, and engaging with your community.
                        Essentially, you must resist the forcefully imposed status quo since not engaging in violence—
                        by not partaking in the resistance—
                        you get sucked under into a whirlpool of exploitation.
